# System engineering & Devops

Module of **System engineering** and **Devops**, carried out during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **[ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/)**.

## Projects
All of the following folders are projects done during the studies:

| Project name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [`0x00-shell_basics`](https://github.com/aysuarex/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x00-shell_basics) | It aims to learn about basics commands, navigation, files and directories in **Shell** |
| [`0x01-shell_permissions`](https://github.com/aysuarex/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x01-shell_permissions) | It aims to learn about man pages, permissions (owner, group and other) of files and directories in **Shell** |
| [`0x02-shell_redirections`](https://github.com/aysuarex/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x02-shell_redirections) | It aims to learn about how to handle standard input and output and how to combine commands and filters with redirections in **Shell** |
| [`0x03-shell_variable_expansions`](https://github.com/aysuarex/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions) | It aims to learn about alias builtin, help builtin, local, global and reserved variables (PATH, HOME and PS1), special parameters `$?` and single an double quotes in **Shell** |
| [`0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing`](https://github.com/aysuarex/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing) | It aims to learn about loops (`while`, `until` and `for`), condition statements (`if`, `else`, `elif` and `case`), shebangs and how to create SSH keys with **Bash** |
| [`0x05-processes_and_signals`](https://github.com/aysuarex/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x05-processes_and_signals) | It aims to learn about PID, processes and commands that handles them (`ps`, `pgrep`, `pkill`, `kill`, etc) in **Bash** |
| [`0x06-regular_expressions`](https://github.com/aysuarex/alx-system_engineering-devops/edit/master/0x06-regular_expressions) | It aims to learn about how to build a regular expression |

| [`Command Line For The Win`](https://github.com/aysuarex/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/command_line_for_the_win) |  This aims to gain mastery of command line commands across different difficulties |
